# Discord Bot Project - Design Clarification

This project is a **Discord bot** for managing an Undisputed Boxing League, not a web application. Discord bots operate entirely within Discord's interface and don't require traditional visual design guidelines.

## What This Bot Does:
- Automatically DMs fighters when matched
- Sends fight chat links via DM
- Notifies participants of new messages in their fight chats
- Monitors and manages active fight matches

## Design Scope:

**Discord bots don't have a visual interface** - they work through Discord's existing UI via:
- Text-based commands
- Direct messages
- Embedded messages (Discord's built-in rich message format)

## If You Want Visual Design Guidelines:

Would you like me to create design guidelines for one of these options?

### Option A: Admin Dashboard
A web panel where league administrators can:
- View all active fights
- Manually create/manage fight chats
- See fighter statistics
- Monitor bot activity
- Configure bot settings

### Option B: Public League Website  
A marketing/informational site featuring:
- League standings and rankings
- Fight schedules and results
- How to join/participate
- Rules and regulations
- Fighter profiles

### Option C: Just the Bot
Continue with bot-only implementation (no visual design needed)

**Please clarify which option you'd like, and I'll provide comprehensive design guidelines accordingly.**
